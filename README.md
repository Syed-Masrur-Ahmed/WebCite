# WebCite 
**WebCite allows near-instant visualization and organization of the citation network around nearly any scholarly paper â€” just enter a DOI!**

## Overview
WebCite accepts a DOI and an adjustable query limit. Once a valid DOI has been entered, the website produces a dynamic visualization of citations, illustrated through a simple graph. We help academics quickly identify the most relevant work in their field, discover seminal papers, and trace the evolution of ideas through academic literature.

## Features
- Creates an interactable graph where the nodes are academic papers and edges are citations
- Custom Node limit for total numbers of nodes shown
- Hovering over nodes gives information such as title, authors and DOI
- Clicking on a node redirects user to paper
